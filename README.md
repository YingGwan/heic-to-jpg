# heictojpg
HEIC to JPG file format batch conversion script

To run this script, copy it to a folder containing the HEIC images you want to convert and run it. It will non-recursively convert all images in the folder. You will need to have ImageMagick installed for the script to work: https://www.imagemagick.org/

Improvement: 1. all input and output variables are written at the beginning of the script
